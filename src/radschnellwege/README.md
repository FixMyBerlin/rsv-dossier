## Data

The [`meta/meta.json`](./meta/meta.json) is a combined file, for all cycle highways. It collects not-structured data and information.

The individual `geojson` files in the `geometry` folder are individual. They containing solely the geodata for one cycle highway.

The both datasets are matched through the filename of the `geojson` and the `id` in the meta file.
