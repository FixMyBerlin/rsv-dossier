This site show's general information about Radschnellverbindungen (cycle highways) in Germany and specific about specific highways which are planned or build.

## Developing

If you found any bugs feel free to create an issue.

## Data

You find the geometry and meta information about the highways under [`./src/radschnellwege/`](./src/radschnellwege/). There is one file for all highways in [`meta/`](./src/radschnellwege/meta) folder containing the meta information. In the [`geometry/`](./src/radschnellwege/geometry) folder, every cycle highway has one individual file. In [`./data/schema/`](./data/schema/)you'll find the schema for the json files. It enables the validation of the files via gatsby.

### Getting Started

For starting developing, the following steps could be helpful for getting started:

- Use or nvm to install Node.js: `nvm use`
- Install dependenices: `npm install`
- Start gatsby develop service: `npm start`
- Use `npm run` to see a list of commands
- Use `npm run build && npx serve public` to test the build

We use husky to ensure commits don't include linting issues. If you use nvm, as suggested here, you should create a `~/.huskyrc`. See [docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=command-not-found)

Setup your `.env.development` file, for which you can use `.env.defaults` as a start.

For production you will also need a `.env.production` file. Otherwise the modules using the env variables, will not work.
