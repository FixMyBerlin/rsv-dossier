This site show's general information about Radschnellverbindungen (cycle highways) in Germany and specific about specific highways which are planned or build.

## üíæ Data

TLDR: The (geo)data is available in the [`content/geometries/`](./src/radschnellwege) folder. If you use the data, attribute it like this:

> ¬© [FixMyCity](https://fixmycity.de)/[RSV-Dossier](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/rsv-dossier) - [ODbL License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/index.html)

You find the geometry and meta information about the highways under [`./src/radschnellwege/`](./src/radschnellwege/). There is one file for all highways in [`meta/`](./src/radschnellwege/meta) folder containing the meta information. In the [`geometries/`](./src/content/geometries) folder, every cycle highway has one individual file. In [`./data/schema/`](./data/schema/)you'll find the schema for the json files.

See [**README.md**](./src/radschnellwege/README.md) for more details.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developing

If you found any bugs feel free to create an issue.

### Getting Started

For starting developing, the following steps could be helpful for getting started:

- Use or nvm to install Node.js: `nvm use`
- Install dependenices: `npm install`
- Start astro develop service: `npm start`
- Use `npm run` to see a list of commands

We use husky to ensure commits don't include linting issues. If you use nvm, as suggested here, you should create a `~/.huskyrc`. See [docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=command-not-found)

Setup your `.env.development` file, for which you can use `.env.defaults` as a start.

For production you will also need a `.env.production` file. Otherwise the modules using the env variables, will not work.

## Keystatic and Blog
